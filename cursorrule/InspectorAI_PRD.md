# InspectorAI: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Vision
InspectorAI aims to enhance the Cursor agent's capabilities by providing an autonomous system for verifying website designs and diagnosing errors. It ensures that designs, such as a hero section, meet expected standards before the agent proceeds, reducing the need for human oversight and improving efficiency.

## Problem Statement
When the Cursor agent designs website elements, there's a need to verify if the design renders correctly. If there are issues, such as rendering errors or network failures, the agent should diagnose and fix them autonomously, ensuring a seamless workflow.

## Target Users
- **Primary User**: The Cursor agent, which interacts with InspectorAI to verify designs and handle errors.
- **Secondary Users**: Developers and users who use the Cursor agent, benefiting from its enhanced capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. Autonomous Design Verification
- Automatically captures screenshots after the Cursor agent completes a task (e.g., designing a hero section).
- Shares the screenshot with the Cursor agent for verification, enabling it to approve or redesign.
- Supports iterative design improvements until the design is correct.

### 2. Error Detection and Reporting
- If the screenshot shows no website (e.g., blank page or error screen), checks console logs for JavaScript errors.
- Monitors network requests for failures, such as 404 or 500 status codes.
- Provides detailed feedback to the Cursor agent for debugging.

### 3. Interactive Interface
- Allows the Cursor agent to ask specific questions, such as checking logs, taking screenshots, or editing elements.
- Supports commands to modify DOM elements based on the agent's instructions.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Browser Interaction
- Navigate to any given URL using a headless browser.
- Capture full-page or element-specific screenshots (e.g., `.hero-section`).
- Access and retrieve console logs, including errors like `Uncaught TypeError`.
- Intercept and analyze network requests and responses, such as API call statuses.
- Interact with DOM elements, such as editing text or styles.

### 2. Analysis and Decision Making
- Verify if the design in the screenshot matches expected criteria (e.g., presence of specific text or elements).
- Determine if there are rendering issues or errors by analyzing logs and network data.
- Provide feedback to the Cursor agent, such as "Design verified" or "Error: Console log shows undefined variable."

### 3. API for Communication
- Expose REST API endpoints for the Cursor agent to send commands (e.g., `POST /analyze`) and receive data (e.g., `GET /logs`).
- Support commands like capturing screenshots, checking logs, and editing elements.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- Efficiently capture and analyze data to avoid delays, especially for large or dynamic websites.
- Handle multiple tasks or URLs if the Cursor agent works on several sites.

### 2. Security
- Ensure no sensitive information (e.g., user data in logs) is exposed or stored.
- Use secure communication methods if needed, such as HTTPS for API calls.

### 3. Scalability
- Designed to handle increasing complexity as the Cursor agent's tasks grow, such as verifying multiple sections.

## Assumptions and Dependencies
- The Cursor agent can interact with InspectorAI's API, following its rules for design verification.
- The website is accessible and can be rendered by the chosen browser (e.g., Chrome).
- The tool runs on the same machine or network as the Cursor agent for seamless communication.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure Puppeteer works with the version of Chrome used. Mitigation: Test on multiple Chrome versions.
- **Performance with Large Pages**: Optimize screenshot capture and log retrieval for complex websites. Mitigation: Implement caching or batch processing.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for cases where the website cannot load. Mitigation: Include timeout mechanisms and fallback strategies.

## Success Metrics
- The Cursor agent successfully verifies and approves designs with minimal iterations (e.g., less than 3 redesigns on average).
- The tool reduces debugging time by providing actionable error feedback, measured by faster task completion.
- The agent can autonomously handle a variety of tasks, such as designing and verifying multiple sections, without human intervention.

## Technical Stack Recommendations
- **Browser Automation**: Puppeteer
- **Backend/Server**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Analysis and Processing**: Tesseract.js (for OCR in screenshots)
- **Utilities**: Dotenv, Winston (for logging)
